# React Native AsyncStorage getItem Inconsistently Returns Null

This repository demonstrates a bug where AsyncStorage.getItem() in React Native inconsistently returns null, even when the key exists.  The issue is intermittent and difficult to reproduce reliably.  The provided solution uses a retry mechanism to improve data retrieval.

## Bug

The bug occurs in `bug.js`.  The app attempts to load data from AsyncStorage.  Even when the key exists, `getItem` sometimes returns null. This leads to unexpected behavior in the application.

## Solution

The solution in `bugSolution.js` addresses the issue by adding a retry mechanism that attempts to retrieve the data multiple times before giving up. This significantly improves the reliability of data retrieval from AsyncStorage.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app on a React Native simulator or device.
4. Observe the inconsistent behavior of data loading. The original code will show null values when it should load values from AsyncStorage, whilst the solution will not have this problem.
